      <p>Happy Father's Day. I wanted to express my adoration of you as a father in a silly way. I have developed this blank slate of a website to host your musical creations and any other relevant endeavors that you would like to pursue in your life. I hope that this will make you feel more "official" on the internet, given that you can point someone here and tell them to look at your portfolio.</p>
      <p>I hear the jury's still out on science. I care deeply for nature. Really? Did nothing cancel? Across from where?</p>
<p>As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. <strong> Army had half a day.</strong> <em> There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.</em> Well, what do you expect, mother?</p>
<h2>That's why you always leave a note!</h2>
<p>Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.</p>

          <h3>That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'</h3>
          <p>Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! I've opened a door here that I regret. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.</p>

          <p>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Steve Holt! Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
          <p>I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.</p>
          <p>He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Marry me. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Across from where?</p>

        <p>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. That's why you always leave a note! Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
